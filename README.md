# OpenSCAD Mechanical Keyboard Generator

## Wut?
Project using openpyscad to generate a mechanical keyboard in OpenSCAD, from a keyboard-layout-editor.com layout JSON.

## Why?
There's at least one project already doing this, but it's unmaintained and I want to 3D print a keyboard case + plate

## But where's the case and plate?
They're coming, for now I'm just generating the layout, the rest will come. Looking for input and improvement suggestions too!

## To-do
* Generate stabilizers
* Generate a keyboard plate
* Generate a case
